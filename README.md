Project Overview:
AtliQ is a company that sells hardware products, such as PC mice 🖱️, printers 🖨️, and more, to various customers including retail stores (e.g., Best Buy 🏬, Croma, Staples) and online platforms (e.g., Flipkart 💻).

Additionally, AtliQ engages in three sales channels: retailer, distributor, and direct.

This project focuses on utilizing Excel 📊 to create comprehensive Sales Analytics and Finance Analytics for AtliQ, providing valuable insights to enhance business performance across these different sales channels
